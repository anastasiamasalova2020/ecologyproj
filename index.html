		<p>
		Renewable energy is energy derived from natural resources that replenish themselves in less than a human lifetime without depleting the planet’s resources. These resources – such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides, waves, biomass and thermal energy stored in the earth’s crust – are available in one form or another nearly everywhere. They are virtually inexhaustible. And, what is even more important, they cause little climate or environmental damage.
        </p>
        <p>
        Fossil fuels such as oil, coal, and natural gas on the contrary are available in finite quantities only. As we keep extracting them, they will run out sooner or later. Although produced in natural processes, fossil fuels do not replenish as quickly as we humans use them.
        </p>
        <p>
		Today, the world still heavily relies on fossil fuels and even continues subsidising them. Meanwhile, the pollution they cause – from climate-damaging greenhouse gases to health-endangering particles – has reached record levels. And when something goes wrong, for example when the Deepwater Horizon oil platform exploded in 2010, the consequences are dramatic.
	   </p>
        <p>
        Since 2011, renewable energy is growing faster than all other energy forms. Renewable energy had another record-breaking year in 2019, as installed power capacity grew more than 200 gigawatts (GW) – its largest increase ever.

		1. Solar energy, when properly harnessed could meet earth’s energy demand for a whole year-round. 
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
        2. 50% of the energy used in the United States of America is sourced from biomass.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
		3. China is the world leader in wind power generation.
	   </p>
	   <hr>
        <p>
        4. In some countries, renewable energy is cheaper than fossil fuels. Renewable energy is a much cheaper alternative in some countries because of their ability to harness sources of energy that are prevalent to their location.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
        5. Renewable energy creates three times more jobs than fossil fuels.
